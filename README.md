# Dog-Breed Classifier

In this project, I develop an algorithm for a Dog Identification Application, a Dog-Breed-Image-Classifier.

# Getting Started
In this notebook, I will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, I code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project.

# Sample Dog Output

In this real-world setting, I'll need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed.
